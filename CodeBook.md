**The original data was transformed by**

Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive activity names.
Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

**Data**

The Tidy.txt data file is a text file, containing space-separated values.

The first row contains the names of the variables, which are listed and described in the Variables section, and the following rows contain the values of these variables.

**About variables:**
